### Hello, World! 👋😃

My name is Matheus and I'm a software development student starting my career. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C#. I was atracted by the simplicity and readability of python and by the ecosystem of C#. It's been really interesting learn these two at the sime time.

- 💻 My interests in tech are: backend development, networks and a little bit of cyber security.

- 🔭 I'm very curious about how things work and how to build things on my own.

- ⚡Fun facts: in my free time (not so much) I like to play my piano 🎹 and gardening 🌳
